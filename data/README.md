Resources
=========

This directory contains the core resources including the pronunciation dictionary and phoneset definitions used by scripts elsewhere.

It also contains the original resource (in `ref`) from which this is derived. The data contained in this directory is considered a *Derivative Work* of the dictionary contained in `ref`.

- `pronundict.txt` is the full pronunciation dictionary in the *flat* format and *hts* phoneset representation. Use the scripts in `../scripts` for format and phoneset conversion.


### Development

- Current Afrikaans dictionary (`pronundict.txt`) originates from `./ref/rcrl_apd_20110311/rcrl_apd.1.4.1.txt`
- Small TTS optimisations:
   -- Merging of diphthongs and affricates (TODO: list)
   -- Remove acute accent diacritic (entries) -- see grapheme set in `graphemeset.txt`
- Syllabification done semi-automatically to consider morpheme boundaries and phonotactic constraints (described in publication to follow, notes on splitting of consonant clusters below)
- Stress marking inserted: TODO


#### Notes on splitting of consonant clusters

SPLIT THESE WHEN:

bl	(None, presumably: sub-, compounds)
br	(sub-, compounds)
dr	(None -- don't occur at compound boundaries because of final-devoicing)
dw	(None -- don't occur at compound boundaries because of final-devoicing)
fl	(af-, hoof-, self-, half-, -lik, -loos, compounds)
fr	(af-, hoof, self-, half-, compounds)
gl	(NOTINDICT)
gr	(NOTINDICT)
gw	(NOTINDICT)

kw	(None, presumably: compounds)
pl	(-lik, -loos, op-, compounds)
pr	(op-, compounds)
tr	(compounds, uit-, ont-)
tw	(None, presumably: compounds)
vr	(None -- don't occur at compound boundaries because of final-devoicing)
xl	(-lik, compounds)
xr	(compounds)

kn	(always, except when occuring morph-initially)

sk	(compounds, des-, mis-, dus-, eens-, eers-, trans-) (e.g. intra: whiskey, askies, miskien, moskou, muskadel, miniskule, masker)

rare:
